"""
Python bindings for SCTP. It is compatible with kernel-level SCTP
implementations with BSD/Sockets API.

For the users, the relevant classes and functions are:

features()
sctpsocket(): base class, ought not used directly, althrough it can be
sctpsocket_tcp(): TCP-style subclass
sctpsocket_udp(): UDP-style subclass

SCTP sockets do NOT inherit from socket._socketobject, instead they
CONTAIN a standard Python socket, and DELEGATE unknown calls to it.
So it should fit in most places where a "real" socket is expected.

When receiving data, it is also possible to receive metadata in the
form of events. An event will be one of the following classes:

sndrcvinfo(): 
notification(): 
assoc_change():
paddr_change(): 
send_failed(): 
remote_error(): 
shutdown_event(): 
pdapi_event(): 
adaptation_event(): 

Every SCTP socket has a number of properties. Two "complex" properties,
that contain a number of sub-properties, are: 

sctpsocket.events = event_subscribe()
sctpsocket.initparams = initparams()

Please take a look in the classes' documentation to learn more about
respective sub-properties.

Most SCTP-specific macros are available as constants in Python, so 
an experienced SCTP/C API programmer will feel at home at pysctp.
The only difference is that constants used only inside a particular
event, are defined as class constants and not as module constants,
to avoid excessive namespace pollution.

########### EVENT SUBSCRIBING CLASS

class event_subscribe(object):

	This class implements subproperties for sctpsocket.events "property". 

	Variables and methods:

	autoflush: Boolean value that indicates if properties settings should be
		   immediately transmitted to kernel. Default = True.

	flush(): Flushes the properties to the kernel. If autoflush is True, it will
		 be called every time a property is set.

	clear(): Sets all properties to False, except data_io that is always set to
		 True. Guarantees that sctp_recv() will only return when an actual 
		 data message is received.

	When the class is insantiated, it gets the kernel default values. So, if the
	application just want to change one or two properties from the implementation
	default, it should not need to use clear().

	Properties: Every property sets whether a event class will or not be received 
	via recvmsg() or sctp_recv().

	data_io: refers to sndrcvinfo() (*)
	association: refers to assoc_change() event
	address: refers to paddr_change() event
	send_failure: refers to send_failed() event
	peer_error: refers to remote_error() event
	shutdown: refers to shutdon_event() 
	partial_delivery: refers to pdapi_event()
	adaptation_layer: refers to adaptation_event()

	(*) sndrcvinfo is ALWAYS returned by sctp_recv() along with message data. The
	    data_io property just controls whether sndrcvinfo() contains useful data.

#################### THE REAL THING :)

class sctpsocket(object):
	"""
	This is the base class for SCTP sockets. In general, the user will use sctpsocket_tcp()
	and sctpsocket_udp(), althrough it can use directly this class because all required
	functionality is, by design, implemented *here*. The subclasses are offered just for
	user convenience.

	This class does NOT inherit from python standard sockets. It CONTAINS a python socket
	and DELEGATES unknown method calls to that socket. So, we expect that sctpsocket 
	objects can be used in most places where a regular socket is expected. 

	Main methods:

	bindx: allows to bind to a set of network interfaces (standard bind() allows
	bind to exactly one or then to all).
	connectx: allows to connect by specifying a list of remote addresses.

	(For those that do not know SCTP: SCTP allows "multihomed" associations, i.e.
	connections over a set of peer addresses. If the primary address fails to
	respond (e.g. due to a network failure) it falls back to a secondary address.
	It is intended for automatic network redundancy.)
	
	getpaddrs: Gets the list of remote peer addresses for an association
	getladdrs: Gets the list of local addresses for an association
	sctp_send: Sends a SCTP message.  Allows to pass some SCTP-specific parameters.
		   If the specific parameters are not relevant, send() or sendto()
		   can also be used for SCTP.
	sctp_recv: Receives a SCTP messages. Returns SCTP-specific metadata along
		   with the data. If the metadata is not relevant for the 
		   application, recv()/recvfrom() and read() will also work.
	peeloff: Detaches ("peels off") an association from an UDP-style socket.
	accept: Overrides socket standard accept(), works the same way.
	set_peer_primary: Sets the peer primary address 
	set_primary: Set the local primary address

	In addition, socket methods like bind(), connect() close(), set/getsockopt()
	should work as expected. We tried to implement or override just the socket
	methods that have special behaviour in SCTP.

	Delegation methods (use with care):

	sock(): returns the contained Python standard socket.
	__getattr__(): this method does the delegation magic, forwarding all 
		       unknown attribute inquiries to the python socket.

	Properties:
	
	nodelay: If True, disables Nagle algorithm, which causes any message to be immediately
		 sent, potentially creating too much "tinygrams". Because of message-oriented
		 nature of SCTP, some implementations have it turned on by default, while TCP 
		 is mandated to have it off by default.

	adaptation: 32-bit value related to the "ppid" metadata field sent along each data
		  message. If this property is different than zero, the configured value
		  is sent via ADAPTION INDICATION event to the remote peer when a new 
		  association is opened. This is intended to be used by telephony-related
		  protocols.

	disable_fragments: if True, a message will never be fragmented in several datagrams.
			   It means that message must fit in the PMTU datagram. Default is
			   False for most implementations.

	mappedv4: If True, all IPv4 addresses will be received as IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses
		  (::ffff:0:0/96). The default is True. Otherwise, the application can receive
		  either pure IPv6 or IPv4 addresses.

	maxseg: Maximum segment size i.e. the size of a message chunk inside a datagram,
	        in bytes. This value indirectly limits the size of the whole datagram, since
		datagram = maxseg + a fixed overhead.

	autoclose: For UDP-style sockets, sets/gets the auto-closing timeout for idle 
		   associations, in seconds. A value of 0 means that no automatic close
		   will be done. This property does not work for TCP-style sockets.

	ttl: Default timetolive value to use with sctp_send. Default set to 0.

	streamid: Default SCTP stream identifier value to use with sctp_send. Default set to 0.

	IMPORTANT NOTE: the maximum message size is limited both by the implementation 
	and by the transmission buffer (SO_SNDBUF). SCTP applications must configure 
	the transmission and receiving bufers accordingly to the biggest messages it
	excpects to deal with.

	This class overrides peeloff() and makes it raise an exception because
	it is not valid for TCP-style sockets.The get/set methods for autoclose
	property are also disabled that way.

	getpaddrs() and getladdrs() methods are overriden so they can be called

	this type of socket). Still, if a parameter is passed, it is simply 
	ignored, to avoid creating unnecessary interface differences between
	TCP and UDP-style sockets.

	set_primary() and set_peer_primary() are NOT overriden in order
	to omit the assoc_id, so be sure to pass a (zero) assoc_id.

	All functionalities are inherited from the sctpsocket() father class.

	This class represents UDP-style SCTP sockets. Its objects can be used

	An UDP-style SCTP socket can hold several associations via a single
	socket. In addition, associations will be opened automatically when a
	message is sent (via standard sendto() or SCTP-only sctp_send()). It
	resembles sockets communication via UDP, hence the name.

	It is opportune to remember that listen() must be called for UDP-style
	sockets too, because SCTP is, after all, a connection-oriented protocol.

	The associations are also closed automatically after a idle time. The
	timeout is acessible/configurable via sctpsocket.autoclose property.
	The value is in seconds, 120 is a common default. Setting it to zero
	means that associations are never (automatically) closed. 

	Associations can be opened and/or closed manually by passing MSG_EOF flag
	along an empty message (empty messages are not actually allowed by SCTP).
